### How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?

Around 17 hours in total.

### Were there any parts of the lab you found challenging?

It was my first time using localStorage, so figuring out how to save and load data properly took some trial and error. I also tried creating elements with createElement() instead of just throwing strings into innerHTML, which was new for me but actually pretty useful.
